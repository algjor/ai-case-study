## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

    I would recommend this company further investigate offering genomic data analytics in the area of Hematology, to provide patients with blood disorders better healthcare outcomes and an improved quality of life.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

    This additional service would be a proliferation to their existing Oncology solutions and services – as the treatments in Oncology and Hematology are often times tightly linked at healthcare institutions. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

    The genomic data analytics currently used by Tempus in Oncology could be used in Hematology to determine under which circumstances is it better to use treatments as blood transfusions -vs-  chemotherapy -vs- drugs.  

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

    Tempus’ technology would be beneficial in advancing precision medicine through the practical application of artificial intelligence in Hematology.  Using AI to interpret genomics in Hematology would assist in the decision making process for treatment of blood disorders.
